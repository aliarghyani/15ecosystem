# Sprint Status Template
# This tracks development progress through Phase 4 implementation
# Phase 0-3 (Planning/Solutioning) is tracked separately in bmm-workflow-status.yaml

# generated: 2025-11-06
# updated: 2025-11-24 - Added Epic 10 (Content Analysis) and Epic 11 (WhisperX)
# project: 15ecosystem
# project_key: 15ecosystem
# tracking_system: file-system
# story_location: "{project-root}/docs/stories"

# ROADMAP NOTES (2025-11-24):
# ============================
# Epic 10 (Content Analysis) is HIGH PRIORITY and prerequisite for:
#   - Epic 9 remaining stories (9-7, 9-11, 9-12, 9-13)
#   - Future semantic search and recommendations
# 
# Epic 11 (WhisperX) is OPTIONAL - evaluate after Epic 10-1 (quality metrics)
#   - Only proceed if PoC (11-1) shows significant quality improvement
#   - Consider cost/benefit: GPU time vs current transcript quality
# 
# Recommended execution order:
#   1. Epic 10 (Content Analysis) - 3-4 weeks
#   2. Epic 9 (Remaining stories) - 2 weeks  
#   3. Epic 11 (WhisperX) - Optional, 2-3 weeks if approved

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
